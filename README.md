## Synopsis ##

Compiler for *Modula-2 Language* developed in *Java* under _GPLv3 General Public License_ during the academic year 2008/2009 in _"Language Processors"_ course in the Faculty of Computer Science at the Complutense University of Madrid.

Addtional tools that have been used for the Syntantic and Semantic analyzers are:
- *JFlex* _Lexical Analyzer_
- *Slk* for the _Semantic Analyzer_

## Motivation ##

The project aims at put into practice all the concepts studied within the _"Language Processors"_ course into a real project as well as other areas of expertise as network.

The project itself represented indeed a perfect simulation of what eventually a real work scenario would feel like for us, meaning that a lot of different people with different profiles working together over the same problem and submitting and integrating their changes on the same repository. As a matter of fact, for some of the team members it was their first experience with a Control Version System software.

## Installation Notes ##
System Requirements:

- Installation of Java JRE 1.5 or later versions.
- Installation of PDF Reader software to visualize the documentation files.
